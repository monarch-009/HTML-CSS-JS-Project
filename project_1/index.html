          <h2>About Maharaj ji</h2>
          <p>
            Pujya Shri Hit Premanand Govind Sharan Maharaj is a Rasik Saint from
            Vrindavan. He epitomizes the "Sahchari Bhav" or "Sakhi Bhav"
            initiated by Anant Shri Vibhushit, Vanshi Avtar, Paratpar Prem
            Swaroop - Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. Genuine spiritual guidance
            has become exceedingly rare in present time. However even in these
            days and this age, Pujya Maharaj Ji is relentlessly simplifying key
            spiritual concepts and making it palatable for the common man. Not
            only is He providing aspirants, a solid foundation but also is one
            of the few Rasik Saints who is graciously bestowing the most
            confidential and supremely sacred 'Vrindavan Nivrit Nikunj Upasana'
            and 'Nitya Vihar Ras' which was first shared by Prem Swaroop, Vanshi
            Avtar Shri Hit Harivansh Mahaprabhu. Pujya Shri Maharaj Ji
            encourages us to surrender completely to PriyaPriyatam. This
            unconditional surrender will help us attain Eternal Bliss (चिदानंद)
            or state of Prem (प्रेम) which can’t be provided even by the most
            rigorous and austere spiritual practice (साधना) because often
            despite of intense sadhana one may not completely overcome bodily
            consciousness (देह भाव) and the False Ego (अहंकार) both of which are
            detrimental in attaining pure love for PriyaPriyatam.
